# Instructions
For this homework you will write a script to do some useful calculations for credit card payments. Use the template provided below. At a minimum, your script should contain the functions get_min_payment(), interest_charged(), remaining_payments(), and main(), each of which is described below. Be sure to include a docstring in each function.

> Note: The  resulting  script  is  only  an  example  of  a  remaining  payments  calculator  and  may  not accurately reflect the same calculation methods as your personal credit card. This script should not be used to make financial decisions.


# get_min_payment()
**Parameters**
- The  total  amount  of  the  balance  in  an  account  that  is  left  to  pay  (called  the  balance;  you  can assume this is a positive number)
- The  fees  associated  with  the  credit  card  account  (you  can  assume  this  is  a  positive  integer; assign this parameter a default value of 0)

**Functionality**
1. Compute the minimum credit card payment. (**min_payment**). You should use the formula **min_payment = ((b * m) + f)** where
    -  b is the balance in the account
    -  m  is  the  percent  of  the  balance  that  needs  to  be  paid  (represented  as  a  float  where  2%  is represented as .02). Make the constant value of this variable .02. Note: This is not the same thing as the APR.
    -  f is the amount of fees that will be paid per month.
2. Determine  if  the  minimum  payment  that  was  computed  using  the  formula  is  below  25.  If  is  is, we should set the minimum payment to 25 instead. Return this number.

> Note : This  function  takes  into  account  only  balance,  the  minimum  payment  percentage, and  fees.  In  the  real  world,  minimum  credit  card  payments  may  take  more  factors into account.


# interest_charged()
**Parameters**
- The balance of the credit card (the amount in the account that has not been paid off yet; you can assume this is a positive number)
- The annual APR (you can assume this is an integer between 0 and 100; for example, an APR of 5% would be expressed as 5)

**Functionality**
- Compute  and  return  i,  the  amount  of  interest  accrued  in  the  next  payment  according  to  the formula **i = (a/y)*b*d**, where
    - a is the APR expressed as a floating point number(for example, an APR of 8% would be .08)
    - y is the amount of days in a year
    - b is the balance in the account
    - d  is  the  number  of  days  in  a  billing  cycle  (expressed  as  an  integer;  you  can  safely  assume that this will be 30 each time)


# remaining_payments()
**Parameters**
- The  balance  of  the  credit  card  (that  amount  in  the  account  that  has  not  been  paid  off  yet;  you can assume this is a positive number)
- The annual APR (you can assume this is an integer between 0 and 100; for example, an APR of 5% would be expressed as 5)
- The  target  payment  (the  amount  the  user  wants  to  pay  per  payment;  you  can  assume  this  is  a positive number)
- The  credit  line.  The  maximum  amount  of  balance  that  an  account  holder  can  keep  in  their account. (you can assume this is a positive integer; defaults to 5000)
- The amount of fees that will be charged in addition to the minimum payment. (you can assume
this is a positive integer; defaults to 0)

**Functionality**
Compute  and  return  the  number  of  payments  required  to  pay  off  the  credit  card  balance.  We  will do this by simulating payments one at a time until the balance of the credit card reaches zero. We will be assuming fixed payments (in other words, assume that each payment is the same amount of money  as  the  previous  one)  if  and  only  if  the  user  specified  a  target  amount.  Otherwise,  the minimum payment will change according to the balance that remains in the account.

Note  that  (in  our  application)  credit  card  payments  are  broken  down  into  two  parts:  an  interest payment, and a part that pays down the balance of the account. The interest payment is calculated as  described  under  interest_charged();  the  rest  of  the  payment  goes  toward  the  balance  of  the credit card.

    > Note: This  may  not  be  interest  is  computed  in  the  real  world.  For  the  purposes  of  our program we will assume that this is how it is computed.
    
Along  with  computing  the  number  of  months(payments)  required  to  pay  off  the  balance,  this function  should  also  compute  how  many  months(payment  periods)  the  balance  spends  over  75%, 50% and 25% of the maximum allowed credit line.

Here is an algorithm for simulating payments until the credit card is paid off:
- Initialize a counter with a value of zero; this counter represents the number of payments to be made.
- Initialize  3  counters  with  a  value  of  zero;  these  counters  represent  the  number  of  months  that the balance remains over 25%, 50% and 75%, these counters are completely independent of one another  and  also  independent  of  the  counter  that  represents  the  number  of  payments  to  be made.
- As long as the balance of the credit card is positive, repeat the following:
    - Check if the target amount parameter was passed in as None, if it was passed in as None, use the  get_min_payment()  function  to  get  the  min  payment  based  on  the  current  balance  and the fees. The payment amount will either be the minimum payment, or the target amount if it was passed in.
    - Use  the  interest_charged()  function  to  determine  what  portion  of  the  next  payment  will  be interest. The total payment minus interest charged is the amount that will go toward paying the balance. Remember, these amounts will change with every payment.
    - If the payment towards the balance is negative, then this means that the balance increased even after payment. Given the parameter values, the balance will never be paid off. If this is the case, print a message to the user stating that the card balance cannot be paid off and quit the script. Otherwise, the program may continue.
    - Reduce the balance by the part of the payment that goes toward paying the balance.
    - Check  if  the  balance  is  greater  than  75%  of  the  credit  line,  if  so,  increase  the  appropriate counter.
    - Check  if  the  balance  is  greater  than  50%  of  the  credit  line,  if  so,  increase  the  appropriate counter.
    - Check  if  the  balance  is  greater  than  25%  of  the  credit  line,  if  so,  increase  the  appropriate counter.
    - Increase the counter that counts the number of payments that have been performed.
- When  the  balance  of  the  is  no  longer  positive,  the  value  of  the  counter  is  the  number  of payments required. Return the counters all together as a tuple.

    > Note: You can return multiple items at once from a function if you separate each item by a comma.  The  item  returned  will  be  a  tuple  containing  the  items  that  you  returned. Each element in the tuple can be accessed referencing its respective index. 
    

# main()
**Parameters**
- The  balance  of  the  credit  card  (that  amount  in  the  account  that  has  not  been  paid  off  yet;  you can assume this is a positive number)
- The annual APR (you can assume this is an integer between 0 and 100; for example, an APR of 5% would be expressed as 5)
- The  target  payment  (the  amount  the  user  wants  to  pay  per  payment;  you  can  assume  this  is  a positive number; defaults to None)
- The  credit  line.  The  maximum  amount  of  balance  that  an  account  holder  can  keep  in  their account. (you can assume this is a positive integer; defaults to 5,000)
- The amount of fees that will be charged in addition to the minimum payment. (you can assumethis is a positive integer; defaults to 0)

**Functionality**
- Compute the recommended minimum payment using the get_min_payment() function
- Display the recommended minimum payment to the user
- Declare  a  variable  named  pays_minimum  to  False.  This  variable  represents  whether  a  user  has chosen to pay the minimum payment each month or not.
- If  the  user’s  target  payment  is  None,  set  the  pays_minimum  to  True.  Otherwise,  if  the  user’s  target payment  is  less  than  the  minimum  payment,  print  a  message  to  the  user  (e.g.,  "Your  target payment  is  less  than  the  minimum  payment  for  this  credit  card")  and  quit  the  program; otherwise:
    -  Use remaining_payments() to figure out the total number of payments required (hint: we will assume that the beginning balance is the balance amount that was passed in).
        -  If  the  user  pays  the  minimum  payment  each  time,  display  the  number  that  represents the number of payments that need to be made to the user (e.g., "If you pay the minimum payments  each  month,  you  will  pay  off  the  balance  in  <  total  payments  >  payments."; replace the angle brackets with the appropriate values)
        -  If the user does not pay the minimum payments, display the number that represents the number  of  payments  that  need  to  be  made  to  the  user  along  with  what  the  desired payment amount is (e.g., "If you make payments of $< target payment >, you will pay off the  balance  in  <  total  payments  >  payments.";  replace  the  angle  brackets  with  the appropriate values)
    - Return  a  string  that  is  a  message  that  will  tell  the  user  how  many  payments  they  will  be above 25, 50 and 75 percent thresholds.

   > Note: Your returned string should mimic the structure and content of the output provided in the example output below. 


# Running your program
Your program is designed to run from the terminal. To run it, open a terminal and ensure you are
in the directory where your script is saved.

The  program  takes  three  required  command-line  arguments:  a  balance  amount,  an  APR  integer (expressed  as  a  number  between  0  and  100)  and  a  credit  line  amount  (expressed  as  a  positive integer). It also allows the following optional arguments: --payment (the desired monthly payment) and --fees (the amount of monthly fees that the credit card requires). Below are some examples of how  to  use  the  program.  The  examples  assume  you  are  using  macOS  and  your  program  is  called credit_card.py.  If  you  are  using  Windows,  replace  python3  with  python.  If  your  program  has  a different name, replace credit_card.py with the name of your program.

> Basic usage: python3 credit_card.py 15_000 10 17_000
